# react-task-tracker

Front-end was built by following along with TraversyMedia's React crash course video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8

After building out the front-end, I decided to create my own back-end for the project using MongoDB and Express and then attempt to dockerize the application.

---
Running with Docker:
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the main project directory
* Run `make build` to build the docker image
* Run `make up` to start the application
* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`
